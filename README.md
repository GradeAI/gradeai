# Overview

GradeAI is an advanced auto-grader that utilizes state-of-the-art technologies to automatically grade assignments and provide feedback. With the power of OpenAI GPT-3.5, TensorFlow, and Flask, GradeAI can analyze and evaluate various types of assignments, including text-based submissions and image-based assignments with OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

# Features

- AI-based auto-grading: GradeAI employs the cutting-edge OpenAI GPT-3.5 model to provide accurate and comprehensive grading for assignments.
- Text-based grading: GradeAI can analyze text-based submissions and evaluate them based on predefined criteria.
- Image OCR: With the integration of TensorFlow, GradeAI can extract text from images, making it suitable for grading image-based assignments.
- Flask backend: The project utilizes Flask, a lightweight web framework, to handle HTTP requests and serve the auto-grading functionality.
- Easy deployment: GradeAI can be easily deployed on platforms like Vercel or Heroku for seamless integration with web applications.
